                "chunk": "(CTI)-dependent AFL,”2 involves a macroreentrant circuit\r\naround the tricuspid annulus traversing the CTI on the\r\nright side of the heart (Figure 6). This is the arrhythmia\r\nassociated with the classic electrocardiogram (ECG)\r\nfinding of sawtooth flutter waves in the inferior leads\r\nwhen the circuit goes in the counterclockwise direction.\r\nThe same circuit in the clockwise direction is called\r\n“reverse typical AFL.” If the flutter involves a different\r\ncircuit than tricuspid valve/isthmus, then it is called\r\n“atypical” AFL, which is also known as “noncavotricuspid\r\nisthmus–dependent macroreentrant AT.”2 AFL was previously classified as either type I or type II. That terminology is no longer used.\r\n2.3. Mechanisms and Pathophysiology\r\nAF is a chaotic, rapid (300-500 bpm), and irregular atrial\r\nrhythm. Although normal rhythms are conducted through\r\nthe atria in smooth waves initiated by the sinoatrial node,\r\nAF is the result of either electrophysiological abnormalities that underlie impulse generation and/or structural\r\nabnormalities of cellular connections that typically facilitate rapid and uniform impulse conduction. AF often\r\nstems from waves of electrical activity originating from\r\nectopic action potentials most commonly generated in the\r\npulmonary veins (PVs) of the left atrium (LA),1 or in\r\nresponse to reentrant activity promoted by heterogeneous conduction due to interstitial fibrosis.2 Atrial\r\nectopy can generate runs of tachycardia, while persistent\r\nAF requires a substrate that is either sufficiently large or\r\nconduction that is sufficiently heterogeneous to enable\r\nreentrant activity to persist. The electrical abnormalities\r\nevident on the ECG during AF likely represent a shared\r\nphenotype of a condition with many distinct etiologies\r\n(genetic, environmental, and metabolic) (Figure 7).\r\nFIGURE 7 Mechanisms and Pathways Leading to AF\r\nThe pathways that contribute to the development of AF create a substrate for reentry and provide triggers that can initiate arrhythmic activity. AF indicates atrial\r\nfibrillation; PAC, premature atrial contraction; NLRP3, NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3; and RAAS, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\r\nJACC VOL. - , NO. - , 2023 Joglar et al\r\n- , 2023: - – - ---\r\n19\nHypertension, valve\nCoronary artery\nObesity, alcohol\nSleep-disordered\ndisease\ndisease\nabuse\nbreathing\nMetabolic/\nAutonomic\nRAAS activation\nHypoxia, ischemia\nmitochondrial\ndysfunction\ndysfunction\nTranscriptional\nFibrotic and\nSystemic\nOxidative\nand post-\nadipocyte signaling\ninflammation\nstress\ntranscriptional\nremodeling\nSlowed,\nNLRP3\nDisrupted Ca2+\nAtrial hypertrophy,\nheterogeneous\nInflammasome\ncycling, ion channel\ncardiomyopathy\natrial conduction\nactivation\nremodeling\nAF\nIncreased atrial\nectopy (PACs)",

AF can be documented by, for example, 12-lead ECG, rhythm\r\nstrips, wearables, intracardiac electrograms, but will always require visual confirmation that the diagnosis is accurate.\r\nClinical AF With the increasing availability of wearable devices and other continuous monitoring technologies, the distinction between clinical and\r\nsubclinical AF has become increasingly blurred, thus the writing committee felt the term clinical AF has become less useful. Yet, the term\r\nwas kept because most of the evidence from randomized trials that have led to guideline recommendations for the treatment of AF refer to\r\n“clinical AF.” These trials required electrocardiographic documentation of the arrhythmia for inclusion and most patients presented for\r\nclinical evaluation and/or therapy of the arrhythmia.\r\nSubclinical AF Subclinical AF refers to this arrhythmia identified in individuals who do not have symptoms attributable to AF and in whom there are no\r\nprevious ECGs documenting AF\r\nThis includes AF identified by implanted devices (pacemakers, defibrillators, or implantable loop recorders) or wearable monitors\r\nAtrial high-rate\r\nepisodes\r\nThese are defined as atrial events exceeding the programmed detection rate limit set by the device. These are recorded by implanted devices\r\nbut require visual inspection to confirm AF and exclude other atrial arrhythmias, artifact or oversensing.\r\nAF burden AF burden encompasses both frequency and duration and refers to the amount of AF that an individual has. AF burden has been defined\r\ndifferently across studies. For the purpose of this guideline, AF burden will be defined as the durations of an an episode or as a percentage\r\nof AF duration during the monitoring period depending on how it was defined in the individual studies.\r\nFirst detected AF The first documentation of AF, regardless of previous symptoms\r\nParoxysmal AF AF that is intermittent and terminates within #7 d of onset\r\nPersistent AF AF that is continuous and sustains for >7 d and requires intervention. Of note, patients with persistent AF who, with therapy, become\r\nparoxysmal should still be defined as persistent as this reflects their original pattern and is more useful to predict outcomes and define\r\nsubstrate.\r\nLong-standing\r\npersistent AF\r\nAF that is continuous for >12 mo in duration\r\nPermanent AF A term that is used when the patient and clinician make a joint decision to stop further attempts to restore and/or maintain sinus rhythm\r\nAcceptance of AF represents a therapeutic decision and does not represent an inherent pathophysiological attribute of AF\r\nContinued on the next page",

Incidence ranges\r\nfrom 1% to 46% in medical illness,1,12-14 with 6% to 22% in\r\nsevere sepsis,15 and 3% to 16% after noncardiac surgery.16\r\nAF can be an incidental finding during low-risk procedures but can occur associated with a range of conditions,\r\nincluding critical illness or sepsis. A combination of underlying arrhythmogenic substrate and triggers related to\r\nthe acute illness likely contribute to acute AF. Acute AF\r\ncan be paroxysmal or persistent, with or without symptoms, and is associated with higher risk of AF recurrence.1-3 Acute AF is also associated with prolonged\r\nhospitalization13,14 as well as increased morbidity12,15 and\r\nmortality.13,15 Management of acute AF is directed toward\r\ndetection and treatment of potential triggers, optimizing\r\nhemodynamics, rate and/or rhythm control, and reducing\r\nin-hospital and long-term risk of stroke. Rate- or rhythmcontrol strategy should be individualized, balancing the\r\nimpact of rapid rates and atrioventricular dyssynchrony\r\non hemodynamics with ability to tolerate treatment. Decisions regarding initiating anticoagulation should be\r\nbased on risk stratification of patient substrate and\r\ncomorbidities, and the timing should take into consideration bleeding risks and the complexity of the acute\r\nillness.\r\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\r\n1. In patients who develop or are discovered to have AF in\r\nthe setting of acute medical illness and noncardiac\r\nsurgery, recurrent AF was noted in 42% to 68%1,2 and\r\n39%,3 respectively, during 5-year follow-up. Regardless\r\nof presence of an initial precipitant, recurrent AF was\r\nassociated with increased risks of HF (HR, 2.74 [95% CI,\r\n2.39-3.15]; P<0.001), stroke (HR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.30-\r\n1.90]; P<0.001), and mortality (HR, 2.96 [95% CI, 2.70-\r\n3.24]; P<0.001).2\r\n2. In 10,723 patients with newly diagnosed AF (67.9–9.9\r\nyears, 41% women) identified from a longitudinal\r\ndatabase, 19% of patients had an acute AF precipitant,\r\nthe most common being cardiac surgery (22%), pneumonia (20%), and noncardiac surgery (15%). AF recurrence at 5 years was 41% among those with a\r\nprecipitant versus 52% in those without one (adjusted\r\nHR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.69-0.81]; P<0.001) (Figure 27).3\r\nRegardless of a precipitant, recurrent AF was\r\nFIGURE 27 Unadjusted Cumulative Risk of AF Recurrence\r\nUnadjusted curves displaying cumulative risk of recurrent AF, generated using Kaplan-Meier method.

                "chunk": "ANS triggers AF\r\nThe ANS as AF trigger is detailed in several reviews.1-6\r\nSympathetic efferent stimulation releases noradrenaline,\r\nstimulating G-coupled b-adrenergic receptors, enhancing\r\nL-type calcium channels, and increasing inward current\r\n(automaticity/early afterdepolarization). Delayed afterdepolarization occurs via calcium overload and\r\nryanodine-2 receptor dysfunction. Parasympathetic\r\nstimulation shortens atrial effective refractory period by\r\nincreasing IKACh (acetyl-choline receptor mediated inward\r\nrectifying potassium channel) activity. Atrial effective\r\nrefractory period heterogeneity follows the pattern of\r\nautonomic innervation. Sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, alone or combined, can trigger AF.\r\nANS maintains AF\r\nAtrial sympathetic and parasympathetic hyperinnervation and spatial heterogeneity, coupled with electrical\r\nfractionation and altered atrial electrophysiology,\r\ncontribute to substrate.7-10 Modifiable AF risk factors\r\npromote ANS dysfunction.3 AF produces autonomic\r\nafferent reflex deficiencies elicited by decreased cardiac\r\nvolume11,12 and increases sympathetic activity.13 Afferent\r\nabnormalities disrupt blood volume and pressure homeostasis. Similar abnormalities to AF were identified in\r\nHF.14 Afferent ANS dysfunction could link autonomic\r\nwith anatomic remodeling (atrial dilatation15), contributing to AF self-perpetuation.\r\n2.4. Genetics\r\nBoth common forms and familial AF are heritable.1-3 Multiple recent genome-wide association studies have documented >100 loci specific for AF.4,5 Numerous AF loci\r\nappear consistent across multiethnic groups,5 with some\r\npopulation variation.6,7 With large genome-wide genotyped cohorts such as the UK Biobank and the US National\r\nHeart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI’s) Trans Omics\r\nfor Precision Medicine, the genetic architecture of AF is\r\nnow emerging. A UK Biobank study identified TTN loss of\r\nfunction variants in 0.44% of participants, 14% of whom\r\nhad AF.8 In a Trans Omics for Precision Medicine study of\r\nnearly 1300 participants <66 years of age with AF, 10.1%\r\nharbored a disease-associated genetic variant in genes\r\nassociated with inherited cardiomyopathy or arrhythmia\r\nsyndromes (most common were TTN, MYH7, MYH6,\r\nLMNA, and KCNQ1), and 62.8% had variants of undetermined significance. Disease-associated variants were more\r\nprevalent at younger age of AF onset, 16.8% in those <30\r\nyears.9 A smaller study of persons of Hispanic or African\r\nAmerican descent reported 7% of persons with AF onset\r\nat #66 years of age harbored rare likely pathogenic or\r\npathogenic sequence variants, mostly in myocardial\r\nstructural proteins and ion channels.10\r\n2.5.

Because many of these patients\r\nare young, medications are often not tolerated or\r\npreferred. PVI has been shown to be safe and effective in\r\nthis population without resulting in a significant reduction in exercise capacity1 and has been shown to significantly improve QOL.2\r\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\r\n1. In a prospective cohort study of 144 athletes, AF ablation with PVI, including multiple procedures, resulted\r\nin freedom from AF at 1 year in 86% of athletes with\r\nparoxysmal AF and 68% of athletes with persistent AF\r\nover a median follow-up of 3 years.1 Athletes underwent cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing before\r\nand after ablation and, although the sinus rate\r\nincreased on average 10 bpm after ablation (which may\r\nbother some athletes and thus should be discussed\r\nbefore the procedure), no significant changes were\r\nobserved in maximum metabolic equivalents on exercise treadmill testing. In a retrospective cohort study of\r\n133 competitive athletes who underwent catheter\r\nablation for AF with 10-year follow-up, 83% of athletes\r\ndid not have recurrent events and had significantly\r\nimproved QOL scores.2\r\n10.3. Management Considerations in Patients With AF\r\nand Obesity\r\nObesity is a strong risk factor for AF.1 In the Framingham\r\nStudy, overweight and obesity increased the risk of incident AF, with a 4% increase in AF risk per unit increase in\r\nBMI in men and women. Adjusted HRs for AF associated\r\nwith obesity were 1.52 (95% CI, 1.09-2.13; P¼0.02) and 1.46\r\n(95% CI, 1.03-2.07; P¼0.03) for men and women, respectively, compared with individuals with normal BMI. In\r\nthat study, the excess risk of AF associated with obesity\r\nappeared to be mediated through LA dilatation.2 Other\r\nstudies suggest that the risk of AF with obesity is mediated through epicardial and abdominal fat, or structural\r\nchanges in the atria.1,3 Obesity is also associated with\r\nother comorbidities, including hypertension, HF, and\r\nsleep apnea, which themselves predispose to an increased\r\nincidence of AF. Further, higher BMI and obesity are\r\nassociated with an increase in the burden of AF, including",
