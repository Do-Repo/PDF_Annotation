This is the arrhythmia\nassociated with the classic electrocardiogram (ECG)ﬁnding of sawtooth ﬂutter waves in the inferior leads\nwhen the circuit goes in the counterclockwise direction.\nThe same circuit in the clockwise direction is called\n“reverse typical AFL. ”If the ﬂutter involves a different\ncircuit than tricuspid valve/isthmus, then it is called“atypical ”AFL, which is also known as “noncavotricuspid\nisthmus –dependent macroreentrant AT. ”\n2AFL was pre-\nviously classi ﬁed as either type I or type II. That termi-\nnology is no longer used.\n2.3. Mechanisms and Pathophysiology\nAF is a chaotic, rapid (300-500 bpm), and irregular atrial\nrhythm. Although normal rhythms are conducted throughthe atria in smooth waves initiated by the sinoatrial node,\nAF is the result of either electrophysiological abnormal-ities that underlie impulse generation and/or structuralabnormalities of cellular conne ctions that typically facil-\nitate rapid and uniform impulse conduction. AF oftenstems from waves of electrical activity originating from\nectopic action potentials most commonly generated in the\npulmonary veins (PVs) of the left atrium (LA),\n1or in\nresponse to reentrant activity promoted by heteroge-neous conduction due to interstitial ﬁbrosis.\n2Atrial\nectopy can generate runs of tachycardia, while persistentAF requires a substrate that is either suf ﬁciently large or\nconduction that is suf ﬁciently heterogeneous to enable\nreentrant activity to persist. T he electrical abnormalities\nevident on the ECG during AF likely represent a shared\nphenotype of a condition with many distinct etiologies(genetic, environmental, and metabolic) ( Figure 7 ).FIGURE 7 Mechanisms and Pathways Leading to AF\nThe pathways that contribute to the development of AF create a substrate for reentry and provide triggers that can initiate arrhythmic activity.
